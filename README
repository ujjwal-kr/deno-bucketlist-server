Prototype for a REST api for my bucketlist-app project with the DENO runtime env.

Stuff used - 
1. Mongo DB RUST driver
2. OAK middleware framework
3. some kinda JWT generator-decoder
4. uuid cuz i dont understand the driver id logic
5. PASSWORDS ARE NOT HASHED CUZ ITS NOT A PRODUCTION SERVER, or m just lazy
