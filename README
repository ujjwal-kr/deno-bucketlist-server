DENO bucketlist-server
++++++++++++++++++++++

Prototype for a REST api for my bucketlist-app project with the DENO runtime env.

Instructions

Download Deno and.....
just run "deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write --allow-plugin --unstable --watch main.ts"
and hopefully it should work, if it's still stable

Stuff used - 
1. Mongo DB RUST driver
2. OAK middleware framework
3. some kinda JWT generator-decoder
4. uuid cuz i dont understand the driver id logic
5. PASSWORDS ARE NOT HASHED CUZ ITS NOT A PRODUCTION SERVER, or m just lazy

Things to remember --

1. As the PASSWORDS are not hashed, DO NOT use it at production
2. My code is terrible, if you dont understand why I did something, just ping me I will screw you
3. Yeah that's it, you can go through it and learn about it.

WARNING
=======

THIS IS UNSTABLE
I will try to maintain the code but if something breaks with the new changes, feel free to send a PR.
